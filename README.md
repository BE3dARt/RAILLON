# RAILBLAZER
Railblazer is BE3dARt's first 3D multiplayer game using Babylon.js. It is about trains and stuff I don't know about just yet. Developed purely using my own free time, no pressure and no deadline – Just enjoying the beauty of coding.

#About Railblazer
Railblazer is an attempt to meet my long on-going love for rolling stock. Eventually, this project will serve as a framework to introduce the wonderful world of trains to the Javascript game engine Babylon.js. The framework consists of two main parts: track and trains. You will be able to lay down tracks by defining coordinates and control the curve’s wideness or relax and let the algorithm create a railway network for you. Furthermore, you will be able to define trains by different rolling stock units, choose at which position they start, and at which speed they travel along the before defined network of tracks.
The Railblazer framework is intended to be used for small web-based games or non-simulatory applications. Much detail is simplified because it being too complex for me to implement or because the game engine is not physics based by default.
Although I have a rough plan in my mind, I let my heart run free when deciding on what to do next. There are no milestones, no deadlines, and no pressure – Just enjoying the beauty of coding.

#Railmap
Every feature on the road-, uhm, railmap is highly iterative. A ticked box does not mean this specific feature is in its final form, rather it is implemented in its base form. A new goal will be defined for every new iteration.

#Credits
Besides the amazing Babylon.js game engine, everything else is created by me, ranging from the concept, over coding to the 3D models and textures.
