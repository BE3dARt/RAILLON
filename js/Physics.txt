For RAILLON a very simplified physics model is being used. First off, we need to define some terminoligy. Please be aware that the explantion does only applicate to this RAILLON game world.

Locomotive Configuration
* Power (in W)
* Max Velocity (in m/s)

Calculation at Startup
* Tractive Force = Power / Max Velocity (No longer used after acceleration calculation)
* Friction Force = Coefficient * Mass * Gravitational Acceleration (No longer used after acceleration calculation)
* Acceleration = (Tractive Force - Friction Force) / m
* Deceleration = Acceleration * -1

*Implementation*
Formula = dv = dt * a
Accelerate until max veclocity is being reached. Decelerate from current speed to zero. 
Calculate formula with every game frame, plug the received value into the currently implemented velocity calculation. 
Dependent on 'state', subtract or add dv to the current velocity.

*Tractive Effort*
Fromula: F = P / v
This is the force generated by the locomotive(s) to pull the whole consist. In our game world, we will set v equivalent to vmax so that the tractive force becomes constant. This means that a locomotive with a max velocity of 100 km/h can pull double the force of a locomotive with max velocity of 200 km/h.
In real life, the tractive effort will vary dependent on the speed reaching an equilibrium where the loco can no longer accelerate due to the counter force being too high. However, because in RAILLON we neglegt much of these factors, it would not make sense to make velocity dependent on speed because, to my knowledge, this equilibrium will be too high.

*Friction Force*
Formula: F = u * m * g
Friction force is generated by the friction of the rolling stock wheels with the rails. In this equation, m depitcs the mass of the unit and g is the gravitational force extercet on the mass. u is the friction coefficient.
